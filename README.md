> **Wize**[line] **I**nterview **Ex**perience, a wise way to experience interviewing.

A platform dedicated to collect, visualize and provide relevant data to better prepare benchers for their upcoming interviews.

# Description

Given the varying level of scrutiny a Wizeliner may be subjected to during an interview process, a reliable source of guiding and preparation information may be the difference between being selected for the project or not. For this purpose we aim to provide a formal platform that offers Wizeliners the opportunity to build and consult such collective knowledge with the purpose of being better prepared and aware of the common challenges when trying to land a position in a project.

In order to have a standardized data collection, better visualization, understanding client needs and know common mistakes in the interview process, we will provide relevant data to better prepare benchers for upcoming interviews in a platform dedicated to this purpose.
